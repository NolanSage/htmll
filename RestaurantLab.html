 <p>The restaurant is based off of numerous animatronic-hosted pizzerias, most notably Chuck E. Cheese's. The restaurant's name is similar to and may be homage to Fox's Pizza Den, a pizza chain in Pennsylvania. Bloaty's also hosts a playground/arcade for children and animatronic animal characters that cheerfully dance and sing to entertain the patrons (though their purpose is far removed from the effect they actually have, namely making babies cry and terrifying Zim). 
</p>

<p>The interior of Bloaty's was seen in "Bloaty's Pizza Hog", "Gaz, Taster of Pork" and for an instant in "Zim Eats Waffles", and appears run-down, filthy and greasy. The actual restaurant appears again for the first time since the TV series near the end of Issue 14 of the comics (Issue 5 featured an alternate dimension version of the restaurant, however.) 
</p>

<p>Despite their emphasis on dining in, there have been at least two instances in which Bloaty's has delivered: GIR ordered pizza from the chain in "Rise of the Zitboy", and later Dib also ordered from Bloaty's to Zim's house in "Zim Eats Waffles". The restaurant seems to be very understaffed and overworked, like many other businesses seen in the series. 
</p>

<p>Commercials for the restaurant have been seen three times; in the show's canon from the episodes "Bloaty's Pizza Hog" and "Gaz, Taster of Pork", and in one of the stadiums in the non-canon game Nicktoons: MLB. 
</p>

<p>Like most other Earth food, the meals from Bloaty's make Zim ill; in fact, he doesn't even have to come near it for it to sicken him, as was demonstrated in "Rise of the Zitboy". The grease from the pizza also seems to have a very adverse effect on his skin, giving him monstrous blemishes in mere minutes.
